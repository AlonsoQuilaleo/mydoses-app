# Mydoses-app
**Medication Organizer – React Native Mobile Application**

---

## Overview
**MedLog App** is a **mobile-first** application built with **React Native**, designed to help users manage their prescribed medications, track doses, and visualize their schedules through a calendar interface.  

This project is currently in **version 0.0.1 (initiation stage)** and is part of my personal portfolio. The goal is to iterate towards **V0.1**, which will include basic medication registration, authentication, and scheduling features.

## Roadmap

### Current version (V0.0.1)
- Project setup with **React Native**.
- Initial repository structure.
- Planning for authentication and database integration.

### Next version (V0.1 – Prototype)
- **Authentication**  
  - Login with **OAuth** (Google, Apple, etc.).
  - Secure access to user data.
  
- **Medication management**  
  - Register medications with recommended doses (initial set: *Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, Cough syrup*).  
  - Store data in **PostgreSQL** (future: optional **SQLite** for offline-first).
